# Lab: Pose estimation and Augmented Reality
In this lab we will implement pose estimation based on 2D-3D correspondences from scratch!

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then open the project.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Camera calibration](lab-guide/2-camera-calibration.md)
3. [Implement homography-based pose estimation](lab-guide/3-implement-homography-based-pose-estimation.md)
4. [Experiment with Motion-only Bundle Adjustment](lab-guide/4-experiment-with-motion-only-bundle-adjustment.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
